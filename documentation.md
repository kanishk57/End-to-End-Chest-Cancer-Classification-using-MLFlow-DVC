a,  ![alt text](image-1.png)
    could not download TF with/without a specified version.
b,  there was multiple layers of errors, checked proxy, configs, firewall protection, tried upgrading pip, reinstalling python, changed multiple venvs. 
c, eventually when nothing worked i installed all dependencies using Ubuntu WSL because it bypass all the proxy configurations. ![alt text](image-2.png)
